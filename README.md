# Description
My website is a platform that sells guitars.

# Technical Specs
* pages are not in a folder because I'm loading html content using scripts. I didn't want to use templates and I wanted to keep this assignment reactless.

* the first two items in featured gear have detail pages associated with them, the rest I didn't want to implement because I've met the minimum requirement.

* i'm using document.write which may be bad practice is some cases
