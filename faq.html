            Yes, all our guitars come with a manufacturerâ€™s warranty, with the
            duration and terms varying depending on the brand and model.
            Additionally, we offer extended warranties that cover accidental
            damage. For added peace of mind, we also provide instrument
            insurance to protect against theft or catastrophic loss.

            Our insurance options provide different levels of protection to suit
            your needs. <strong>Standard Coverage</strong> offers protection
            against manufacturer defects, including repairs and replacements,
            but does not cover accidental damage or theft.
            <strong>Extended Coverage</strong> extends the protection period and
            includes limited coverage for accidental damage, normal wear and
            tear, and theft. <strong>Premium Coverage</strong> provides the most
            comprehensive protection, covering all aspects of the extended
            insurance plus full accidental damage, theft, and potential service
            upgrades. This tier ensures extensive coverage, giving you maximum
            peace of mind for your instrument.
